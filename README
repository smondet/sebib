Sebib: S-Expressions for BIBliography.

http://sebib.forge.ocamlcore.org



The Sebib project aims at providing highly hackable “Bibliographic
References Management System”. It is a library and a command-line
application which handle an ad-hoc file format based on S-Expressions.





BUILD & INSTALL:

Just typing:
  omake
should check the libraries, and compile everything.

You have then these executable binaries:
* _build/app/sebib.run,
* _build/app/sebib.opt (optional).

Move and rename one of them to somewhere in your $PATH, and you have
installed the application.

To install the library, just do:
  omake install_library
This will install the sebib library using findlib, depending on your
OCaml setup this may require root privileges.
